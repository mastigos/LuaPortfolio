This repository contains two systems, written in Lua, Sunder and Source. They are systems used for a text-based MUD, and handle everything from parsing information, GUI creation, and semi-automation of tasks within the game, including both PvE and PvP content.

Sunder was forked by me from an original project, which was somewhat non-functional at the time. The base is not mine, but a large part of the code is mine, and I was able to deliver a fully functioning and successful system.

Source was a defunct, outdated, and somewhat bare-bones project that I took over as sole developer and maintainer. I turned it into the most effective system in the game, and made many achievements as a result.

Combined, I developed and maintained these for more than five years, and I am immensely proud of what I accomplished. I do not play the game anymore, and so neither project is being actively maintained.
